\section{Adapting Pre-trained Models and the Rise of Large Language Models}

Building on Transformer and GNN techniques, recent advances in Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMLC) have coalesced around two complementary trends: the development of more sophisticated and efficient methods for adapting Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), and the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as powerful, general-purpose reasoning engines.
