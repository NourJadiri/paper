\chapter{Conclusion}
The evolution from traditional fine-tuning to prompt-tuning and the integration of LLMs signifies a fundamental shift in the core research objective within HMLC. The focus is moving away from pure representation learning toward task alignment and holistic system design. The research questions are becoming more systemic: "How can we use an LLM's reasoning abilities to generate the very data we need for training?" or "How can we leverage an LLM to automate the costly process of evaluation?". 
This represents a higher level of abstraction, focusing on aligning the downstream task with the model's pre-existing knowledge.
